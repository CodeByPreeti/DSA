# HuggingFace API Token (Optional but Recommended)
# Get your token from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
# Create a token with "Read" permission (not fine-grained)
# This enables:
# - Faster story generation
# - Better rate limits
# - Priority access to models
# - No cold start delays

REACT_APP_HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here

# Example:
# REACT_APP_HF_TOKEN=hf_aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ1234567890

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env (remove .example)
# 2. Visit https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
# 3. Click "New token"
# 4. Name it "DSA Storytelling App"
# 5. Select "Read" permission (NOT fine-grained)
# 6. Copy the token and paste it above
# 7. Save and restart the app: npm start

# Note: The app works WITHOUT a token, but you'll get:
# - Slower responses (cold start delays)
# - Lower rate limits
# - May see fallback stories more often
